# BMI Calculator

A simple Python program to calculate the **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on user input for height and weight.

## How It Works

This program prompts the user to input:
1. **Height** (in meters).
2. **Weight** (in kilograms).

It then calculates the BMI using the formula:
BMI = Weight/Height^2

The resulting BMI is then printed as an integer.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the file to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the file is located.
3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python bmi_calculator.py
4. Enter your height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) when prompted.
5. The program will output your BMI.
